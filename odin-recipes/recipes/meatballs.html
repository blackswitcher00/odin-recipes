            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Form mixture into balls about 1 ½ inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with your favorite tomato sauce. Enjoy!</li>
